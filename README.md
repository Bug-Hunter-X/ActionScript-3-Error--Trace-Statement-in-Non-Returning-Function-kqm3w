This repository contains an example of a common error in ActionScript 3: using a trace statement inside a function that does not have a return value. The error occurs because the trace statement is not a valid expression, and therefore, it cannot be used as the return value of the function.  The solution demonstrates how to correct this error by either adding a return statement or making the function void.
